## Abstract Summary

Traditionally, Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) has focused on instructional
methods to decrease extraneous cognitive load so that available cognitive resources
can be fully devoted to learning. This article strengthens the cognitive
base of CLT by linking cognitive processes to the processes used by biological
evolution. The article discusses recent developments in CLT related to the
current view in instructional design that real-life tasks should be the driving
force for complex learning. First, the complexity, or intrinsic cognitive load,
of such tasks is often high so that new methods are needed to manage cognitive
load. Second, complex learning is a lengthy process requiring learners’
motivational states and levels of expertise development to be taken into account.
Third, this perspective requires more advanced methods to measure
expertise and cognitive load so that instruction can be flexibly adapted to individual
learners’ needs. Experimental studies are reviewed to illustrate these
recent developments. Guidelines for future research are provided.
