the Team Drive spreadsheet ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gsnSRCWQblFqce0XSDll_huqB2YYvJ1rLtqldG5KFXc/edit#gid=0 )

1) Copy and paste everything from line 9 down into a new file (create new file) in the /_library/ folder. 
  Make sure you are operating within the library branch, or this will not work! (you can double check this in the upper left corner of 
  the page)
2) Give your page a title using the naming format shown here: authorlastname-onewordfromtitle-year.md  
   (do not forget the .md at the end or it will not work!)
3) Using the instructions shown below (with the <<-- text), complete the entry as you noted it in the spreadsheet for each category
4) Once you are done adding in the content, delete all instructions (<<-- text)
5) Double check that you are committing directly to the library branch (first radio bubble)
6) Click the green button "commit new file"
7) Have Mo/Amira check your entry to make sure that it worked correctly
