## Abstract Summary

We develop a model of selective attention to information and apply it to investors' decisions
about whether to obtain information about the value of their portfolio. In our model investors
receive information about the aggregate level of the market and then decide whether to look up
the value of their personal portfolio. Doing so not only provides additional information, but also
increases the psychological impact of information on utility – an impact effect – and increases
the speed of a utility reference point adjustment – a reference point updating effect. The main
prediction of the model is that investors will check the value of their portfolios more frequently
in rising markets but will “put their heads in the sand” when markets are flat or falling. We test
and find support for this prediction with three Scandinavian data sets.
