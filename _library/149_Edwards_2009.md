## Abstract Summary

Postal and electronic questionnaires are a relatively inexpensive way to collect information from people for research purposes. If people
do not reply (so called ’non-responders’), the research results will tend to be less accurate. This systematic review found several ways to
increase response. People can be contacted before they are sent a postal questionnaire. Postal questionnaires can be sent by first class post
or recorded delivery, and a stamped-return envelope can be provided. Questionnaires, letters and e-mails can be made more personal,
and preferably kept short. Incentives can be offered, for example, a small amount of money with a postal questionnaire. One or more
reminders can be sent with a copy of the questionnaire to people who do not reply.
