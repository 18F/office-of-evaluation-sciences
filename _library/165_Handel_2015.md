## Abstract Summary

Traditional models of insurance choice are predicated on fully
informed and rational consumers protecting themselves from exposure
to financial risk. In practice, choosing an insurance plan is a
complicated decision often made without full information. In this
paper we combine new administrative data on health plan choices
and claims with unique survey data on consumer information to
identify risk preferences, information frictions, and hassle costs. Our
additional friction measures are important predictors of choices and
meaningfully impact risk preference estimates. We study the implications
of counterfactual insurance allocations to illustrate the importance
of distinguishing between these micro-foundations for welfare
analysis.
