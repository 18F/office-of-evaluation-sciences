## Abstract Summary

IMPORTANCE: Interventions based on behavioral science might reduce inappropriate
antibiotic prescribing.

OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate (not
guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory
tract infections.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47
primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians
randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received
education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions began between
November 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for the latest-starting sites ended on April 1,
2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded.

INTERVENTIONS: Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination:
suggested alternatives presented electronic order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments;
accountable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing
antibiotics into patients’ electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians
that compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of “top performers” (those with
the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates).

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with
antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute
bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting
each intervention’s effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with
random effects for practices and clinicians.

RESULTS: There were 14,753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69% women) for
antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections during the baseline period and 16 959
visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67%women) during the intervention period. Mean
antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1%at intervention start to 13.1% at intervention
month 18 (absolute difference, -11.0%) for control practices; from 22.1% to 6.1% (absolute
difference, -16.0%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, -5.0%[95%CI, -7.8%
to 0.1%]; P = .66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2%to 5.2%(absolute difference,
-18.1%) for accountable justification (difference in differences, -7.0%[95%CI, -9.1%to -2.9%];
P < .001); and from 19.9%to 3.7%(absolute difference, -16.3%) for peer comparison
(difference in differences, -5.2%[95%CI, -6.9%to -1.6%]; P < .001). Therewere no
statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among primary care practices, the use of accountable
justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of
inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.
