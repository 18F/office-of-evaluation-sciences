## Abstract Summary

The popularity of New Year’s resolutions suggests that people are more likely to tackle their goals immediately
following salient temporal landmarks. If true, this little-researched phenomenon has the potential to help
people overcome important willpower problems that often limit goal attainment. Across three archival field studies,
we provide evidence of a “fresh start effect.” We show that Google searches for the term “diet” (Study 1), gym
visits (Study 2), and commitments to pursue goals (Study 3) all increase following temporal landmarks (e.g., the
outset of a new week, month, year, or semester; a birthday; a holiday). We propose that these landmarks demarcate
the passage of time, creating many new mental accounting periods each year, which relegate past imperfections to
a previous period, induce people to take a big-picture view of their lives, and thus motivate aspirational behaviors.
