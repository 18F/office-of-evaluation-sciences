## Abstract Summary

Many intend to stay fit but fail to exercise or eat healthfully; students intend to earn good grades
but study too little; citizens intend to vote but fail to turnout. How can policy-makers help
people follow through on their intentions? Prompting people to make plans – an intervention
grounded in behavioral science research – leverages the mechanical benefits of advance
scheduling and a range of advantageous cognitive processes to increase follow-through. We
review laboratory and field experiments which reveal that prompting the formation of specific
implementation plans increases follow-through across a range of domains – from vaccinations to
voting. Plan-making prompts are a simple, inexpensive, and powerful tool for helping people
follow through on their intentions while preserving their autonomy.
