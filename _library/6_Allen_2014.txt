## Abstract Summary

Medicaid expansions will soon cover millions of new enrollees, but insurance alone may not ensure that they receive high-quality care.
This study examines health care interactions and the health perceptions
of an Oregon cohort three years after they gained Medicaid coverage.
During in-depth qualitative interviews, 120 enrollees reported a wide
range of interactions with the health care system. Forty percent of the
new enrollees sought care infrequently because they were confused about
coverage, faced access barriers, had bad interactions with providers, or
felt that care was unnecessary. For the 60 percent who had multiple
health care interactions, continuity and ease of the provider-patient
relationship were critical to improved health. Some newly insured
Medicaid enrollees recounted rapid improvements in health. However,
most reported that gains came after months or years of working closely
and systematically with a provider. Our findings suggest that improving
communication with beneficiaries and increasing the availability of
coordinated care across settings could reduce the barriers that new
enrollees are likely to face.
