## Abstract Summary

Governments are increasingly adopting behavioral science techniques for changing individual behavior in pursuit
of policy objectives. The types of “nudge” interventions that governments are now adopting alter people’s decisions
without coercion or significant changes to economic incentives. We calculated ratios of impact to cost for nudge
interventions and for traditional policy tools, such as tax incentives and other financial inducements, and we found that
nudge interventions often compare favorably with traditional interventions. We conclude that nudging is a valuable
approach that should be used more often in conjunction with traditional policies, but more calculations are needed to
determine the relative effectiveness of nudging.
