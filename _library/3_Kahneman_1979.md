## Abstract Summary

This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of
decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory.
Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with
the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are
merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This
tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure
gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally
discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency,
called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is
presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value
is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are
replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly
convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are
generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities.
Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both
insurance and gambling.
