## Abstract Summary

This paper presents results from two large-scale natural field experiments
that tested the effect of social norm messages on tax compliance. Using
administrative data from more than 200,000 individuals in the United
Kingdom, we show that including social norm messages in standard
reminder letters increases payment rates for overdue tax. This result offers
a rare example of social norm messages affecting tax compliance behavior
in a real world setting. We find no evidence that loss framing is more
effective than gain framing. Descriptive norms appear to be more effective
than injunctive norms. Messages referring to public services or financial
information also significantly increased payment rates. The field
experiments accelerated the collection of tax revenue at little cost.
