## Abstract Summary

This paper presents the results of a randomized field experiment that
provided information about key Social Security features to older
workers. The experiment was designed to examine whether it is
possible to affect individual behavior using a relatively inexpensive
informational intervention about the provisions of a public program
and to explore the mechanisms underlying the behavior change. We
find that our relatively mild intervention (sending an informational
brochure and an invitation to a web-tutorial) increased labor force
participation one year later by 4 percentage points relative to the
control group mean of 74 percent.
