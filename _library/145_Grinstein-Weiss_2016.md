## Abstract Summary

We provide new large-scale experimental evidence on policies that aim
to boost household saving out of income tax refunds. Households that
filed income tax returns with an online tax preparer and chose to
receive their refund electronically were randomized into eight treatment
groups, which received different combinations of motivational
saving prompts and suggested shares of the refund to save—25% and
75%—and a control group, which received neither. In treatment conditions
where they were presented, motivational prompts focused on various
savings goals: general, retirement, or emergency. Analysis reveals
that higher suggested that allocations generated increased allocations
of the refund to savings but that prompts for different reasons to save
did not. These interventions, which draw on lessons from behavioral
economics, represent potentially low-cost, scalable tools for policy makers
interested in helping low- and moderate-income households build
savings.
