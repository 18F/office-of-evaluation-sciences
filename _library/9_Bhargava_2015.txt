## Abstract Summary

We address the role of “psychological frictions” in the incomplete
take-up of EITC benefits with an IRS field experiment. We specifically
assess the influence of program confusion, informational complexity,
and stigma by evaluating response to experimental mailings
distributed to 35,050 tax filers who failed to claim $26 million
despite an initial notice. While the mere receipt of the mailing, simplification,
and the heightened salience of benefits led to substantial
additional claiming, attempts to reduce perceived costs of stigma,
application, and audits did not. The study, and accompanying surveys,
suggests that low program awareness/understanding and
informational complexity contribute to the puzzle of low take-up.
