## Abstract Summary

A meta-analysis of prior studies of techniques designed
to induce mail survey response rates was conducted. Research
encompassing 184 effects (study outcomes) in 115 studies
(articles) for 17 predictors of response rate was examined. The
average effect size across all manipulations was r = .065, indicating
an average increase of about 6.5 percent in response rates
for manipulations. Effect sizes for specific predictors and two
potential moderators of effects were examined. Results indicated
that repeated contacts in the form of preliminary notification and
follow-ups, appeals, inclusion of a return envelope, postage, and
monetary incentives, were effective in increasing survey response
rates. Significant effect sizes for the predictors ranged
from an increase in response of 2 percent to 31 percent. Implications
of the results for the conduct of mail surveys and future
research on mail survey response behavior are discussed.
