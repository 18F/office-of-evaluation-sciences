## Abstract Summary

IMPORTANCE: Although concern exists regarding the rate of benzodiazepine use, especially
long-term use by older adults, little information is available concerning patterns of
benzodiazepine use in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To describe benzodiazepine prescription patterns in the United States focusing
on patient age and duration of use.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective descriptive analysis of benzodiazepine
prescriptions was performed with the 2008 LifeLink LRx Longitudinal Prescription database
(IMS Health Inc), which includes approximately 60%of all retail pharmacies in the United
States. Denominators were adjusted to generalize estimates to the US population.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The percentage of adults filling 1 or more benzodiazepine
prescriptions during the study year by sex and age group (18-35 years, 36-50 years, 51-64
years, and 65-80 years) and among individuals receiving benzodiazepines, the corresponding
percentages with long-term (120 days) benzodiazepine use, prescription of a long-acting
benzodiazepine, and benzodiazepine prescriptions from a psychiatrist.

RESULTS: In 2008, approximately 5.2%of US adults aged 18 to 80 years used
benzodiazepines. The percentage who used benzodiazepines increased with age from 2.6%
(18-35 years) to 5.4%(36-50 years) to 7.4%(51-64 years) to 8.7%(65-80 years).
Benzodiazepine use was nearly twice as prevalent in women as men. The proportion of
benzodiazepine use that was long term increased with age from 14.7%(18-35 years) to 31.4%
(65-80 years), while the proportion that received a benzodiazepine prescription from a
psychiatrist decreased with age from 15.0%(18-35 years) to 5.7%(65-80 years). In all age
groups, roughly one-quarter of individuals receiving benzodiazepine involved long-acting
benzodiazepine use.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite cautions concerning risks associated with long-term
benzodiazepine use, especially in older patients, long-term benzodiazepine use remains
common in this age group. More vigorous clinical interventions supporting judicious
benzodiazepine use may be needed to decrease rates of long-term benzodiazepine use in
older adults.
