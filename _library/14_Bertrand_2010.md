## Abstract Summary

Firms spend billions of dollars developing advertising content, yet there is
little field evidence on how much or how it affects demand. We analyze a direct
mail field experiment in South Africa implemented by a consumer lender that
randomized advertising content, loan price, and loan offer deadlines simultaneously.
We find that advertising content significantly affects demand. Although it
was difficult to predict ex ante which specific advertising features would matter
most in this context, the features that do matter have large effects. Showing fewer
example loans, not suggesting a particular use for the loan, or including a photo
of an attractive woman increases loan demand by about as much as a 25% reduction
in the interest rate. The evidence also suggests that advertising content
persuades by appealing “peripherally” to intuition rather than reason. Although
the advertising content effects point to an important role for persuasion and related
psychology, our deadline results do not support the psychological prediction
that shorter deadlines may help overcome time-management problems; instead,
demand strongly increases with longer deadlines.
