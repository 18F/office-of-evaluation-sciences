## Abstract Summary

We present evidence from randomized field experiments that 401(k)
savings choices are significantly affected by one- to two-sentence anchoring,
goal-setting, or savings threshold cues embedded in emails sent to employees
about their 401(k) plan. Even though these cues contain little to no marginal
information, cues that make high savings rates salient increased 401(k)
contribution rates by up to 2.9% of income in a pay period, and cues that make
low savings rates salient decreased 401(k) contribution rates by up to 1.4% of
income in a pay period. Cues affected 401(k) contribution rates for up to a year
after the email.
