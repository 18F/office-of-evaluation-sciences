## Abstract Summary

To further develop tailored interventions, their working mechanisms must be identi ed. In the present study, three
tailored messages that each contained one potential working mechanism—personalization, adaptation or feedback—
were compared with a standard information condition. Two hundred and two students who smoked tobacco daily
were randomly divided over four conditions. After the computer pre-test questionnaire, they read the information in
their condition and lled in the immediate post-test. After 4 months, they were sent a follow-up questionnaire
assessing their quitting activity. The data show that personalization (44.5%) and feedback (48.7%), but not
adaptation (28.6%), led to signi cantly more quitting activity after 4 months than did the standard information
(22.9%). Moreover, the e ect of condition on quitting activity was completely mediated by individuals' evaluations of
the tailoring.
