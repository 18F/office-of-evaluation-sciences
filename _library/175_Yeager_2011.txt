## Abstract Summary

Recent randomized experiments have found that seemingly “small” socialpsychological
interventions in education—that is, brief exercises that target
students’ thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in and about school—can lead to
large gains in student achievement and sharply reduce achievement gaps
even months and years later. These interventions do not teach students academic
content but instead target students’ psychology, such as their beliefs
that they have the potential to improve their intelligence or that they belong
and are valued in school. When social-psychological interventions have lasting
effects, it can seem surprising and even “magical,” leading people either
to think of them as quick fixes to complicated problems or to consider them
unworthy of serious consideration. The present article discourages both
responses. It reviews the theoretical basis of several prominent social-psychological
interventions and emphasizes that they have lasting effects
because they target students’ subjective experiences in school, because they
use persuasive yet stealthy methods for conveying psychological ideas, and
because they tap into recursive processes present in educational environments.
By understanding psychological interventions as powerful but context-
dependent tools, educational researchers will be better equipped to take
them to scale. This review concludes by discussing challenges to scaling psychological
interventions and how these challenges may be overcome.
