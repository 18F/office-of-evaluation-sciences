## Abstract Summary

We provide evidence from eld experiments with three dierent banks, that
reminder messages increase commitment attainment for clients who recently opened commitment
savings accounts. Messages that mention both savings goals and nancial incentives are par-
ticularly eective, while other content variations such as gain versus loss framing do not have
signicantly dierent eects. Nor do we nd evidence that receiving additional late reminders has
an additive eect. These empirical results do not map neatly into existing models, so we provide
a simple model where limited attention to exceptional expenses can generate under-saving that
is in turn mitigated by reminders.
