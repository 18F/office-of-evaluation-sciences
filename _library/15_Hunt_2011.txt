## Abstract Summary

This paper evaluates a series of programs run by a company called OPOWER to send Home Energy Report
letters to residential utility customers comparing their electricity use to that of their neighbors. Using data
from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United
States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0%. The program provides
additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer
behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost
effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the
treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of
pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by
only 0.3%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of “injunctive norms” played an
insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage.
