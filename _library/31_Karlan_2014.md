## Abstract Summary

We provide evidence from field experiments with three different banks, that
reminder messages increase commitment attainment for clients who recently opened commitment
savings accounts. Messages that mention both savings goals and finnancial incentives are par-
ticularly effective, while other content variations such as gain versus loss framing do not have
significantly different effects. Nor do we find evidence that receiving additional late reminders has
an additive effect. These empirical results do not map neatly into existing models, so we provide
a simple model where limited attention to exceptional expenses can generate under-saving that
is in turn mitigated by reminders.
