This evaluation is currently being implemented. We have created this project page as a mechanism to pre-specify what data will be collected, what we plan to measure, and how weâ€™ll conduct our analysis. We believe this is a critical component of conducting transparent, replicable, and high-quality research; and aim to share our Analysis Plans whenever possible.

The Analysis Plan at the right indicates the date locked, and you can verify our upload date <a href="https://github.com/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/tree/master/assets/analysis">here</a>. 

Check back for results!
