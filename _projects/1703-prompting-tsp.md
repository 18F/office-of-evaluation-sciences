summary: Encouraging higher TSP contribution rates during new employee orientation showed no detectable effect on overall average contribution rates.

## What was the challenge?

The Federal Government operates a savings program for its employees known as the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). New employees are automatically enrolled in the plan at a contribution rate of 3%, and nearly 90% of civilian employees participate in the plan. Civilian employees who contribute to TSP receive matching employer contributions up to a maximum of  5%. However, nearly 1 in 3 new Treasury employees contributed less than 5% in FY 2015, losing overall compensation and retirement security.

## What was the program change?

OES ran a pilot at new employee orientations in three Treasury bureaus. A suite of materials encouraged new employees to consider making a decision to contribute at least 5%, including information on matching contributions, TSP info on new employee checklists, and revised onboarding presentation materials.  

## How did the evaluation work?

Orientation logistics made random assignment infeasible. For the purposes of estimating impacts of the treatment at pilot bureaus, TSP contribution rates were collected at pilot bureaus in the same time period in the year preceding the pilot period, and from the other nine Treasury bureaus during the pilot and pre-pilot periods. 

## What was the impact?

Difference-in-differences analyses showed an increase in the likelihood of a new employee contributing at least 5% to TSP; however, controlling for bureau-level variation, results were not statistically significant, and there was no detectable effect on overall average contribution rates.
