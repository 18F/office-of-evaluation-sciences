## A tool for local conversations

In 2015, the Task Force on 21st Century Policing generated 59 recommendations with 92 action items across 6 pillars. These action items were directed to Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement, government, school systems, and local communities.

This community action deck was developed to empower individual community members to identify concrete actions that can be taken locally to address issues facing their neighborhoods, and connect them to government resources and real-world examples of how these actions have successfully been implemented around the country. A set of 30 cards outlines discussion topics drawn from the final report, focusing on strategies to advance the original recommendations. The deck uses behaviorally-informed principles to communicate action steps in a clear, relevant, and actionable manner. Blank card templates can be used for communities to create their own action steps.
