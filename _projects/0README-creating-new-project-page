Steps to create a new project and post to the website:

TO CREATE A PAGE
1) Search on Flickr.com (using only "US Government work" or "No known copyrights" as the license filter in the top left corner
   to choose a picture that will be the thumbnail and header phonto, save the image to your desktop with your project number as
   the file name, note the image credit (link to the photographer's flickr site) for later use, and then upload the saved image
   into assets/img/project-images/ on this github site.
   - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
2) upload abstract into /assets/abstracts/, name it beginning with the project number and the project title, with dashes (-)
   between words - DO NOT use spaces in the file name
  - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
3) In a new tab, open the _projects folder on github from the main oes repository
4) In the _projects folder, click "create new file" in the uper right corner
5) Once the new page opens, in the text box after "/assets/_projects/", type in:
  - the project number (all four digits), followed by a dash
  - a shorthand project title, with any words separated by dashes (not spaces)
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: 1619-active-choice-tsp.md
6) In the blank text box of the new page you created, copy and paste the text below, beginning with line 31-line 58 (be sure to include the ---,
   into the new page you created in the separate tab. ((( NOTE: the text following the colons (:) below has been maintained as an
   example, and additional notes have been provided following the arrows <<--. This text will need to be removed in your new page.)))
7) Per instructions given to the right of the arrows (<<--), update information for your project and paste in content from project
   slide where instructed (the headers are the same, so the body content will need to be inserted).
8) Eemove all notes pasted in to the form (including <<-- and comments)
9) Scroll down to the radio buttons at the bottom of the page below the text entry box and select "Create a new branch"
10) Name the branch with your project number
11) Commit changes
12) Email Amira and Mo to let us know you have built the page for our review
