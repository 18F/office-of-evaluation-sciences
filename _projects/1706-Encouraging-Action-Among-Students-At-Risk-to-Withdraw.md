## What was the challenge?

Each year, students who continue in a post-secondary program must renew their FAFSA to again receive Federal financial aid. If a student borrower decides to no longer continue in post-secondary education, he or she enters a six month grace period followed by loan repayment. Given the timing of when institutions report students' enrollment status to the Department of Education relative to the grace period, some borrowers may not be prepared to enter repayment and could risk missed payments. Notifying borrowers of the loan repayment timeline could encourage them to take action.  

## What was the program change?

The Department of Education sent emails to first-time, freshman student loan borrowers in the summer after their first year of school, encouraging them to renew their FAFSA for the upcoming academic year if they planned to return or to prepare to enter loan repayment if they did not.

## How did the evaluation work?

The Department of Education randomly selected and emailed approximately 195,000 borrowers in July 2015 --- the summer after their first academic year. An additional 50,000 borrowers were randomly selected into a control group and were not sent emails. Differences in enrollment rates were compared for the Spring 2016 and Fall 2016 academic terms.

## What was the impact?

Borrowers sent emails were 1 percentage point less likely to be enrolled the following Spring semester (37.5 percent) than those who were not sent an email (38.5 percent). The results persisted through the Fall 2016 semester, with borrowers sent the email 0.9 percentage points less likely to be enrolled (31.3 percent vs. 30.3 percent). This could mean that reminding borrowers of this important decision encouraged them to reconsider their financial decision.
