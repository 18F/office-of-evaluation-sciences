## What was the challenge?

Each year, students must decide to remain in a post-secondary program and renew their FAFSA to continue to receive Federal student aid. If a student borrower decides to no longer continue in post-secondary education, they enter loan repayment. Because of the timing of when institutions notify the Department of Education of enrollment status and the loan grace period ends, some borrowers may not be prepared and could risk missed payments. Notifying borrowers of this timeline to conversion to loan repayment could encourage them to take action.   
## What was the program change?

The Department of Education sent emails to first-time, freshman student loan borrowers in the summer after their first year of school, encouraging them to renew their FAFSA for the upcoming academic year if they planned to return or to prepare to enter loan repayment if they did not.

## How did the evaluation work?

The Department of Education randomly selected and emailed approximately 195,000 borrowers in July 2015 --- the summer after their first academic year. An additional 50,000 borrowers were randomly selected into a control group and were not sent emails. Differences in enrollment rates were compared for the Spring 2016 and Fall 2016 academic terms.

## What was the impact?

Borrowers sent emails were 1 percentage point less likely to be enrolled the following Spring semester (37.5 percent) than those who were not sent an email (38.5 percent). The results persisted through the Fall 2016 semester, with borrowers sent the email 0.9 percentage points less likely to be enrolled (31.3 percent vs. 30.3 percent). This could mean that reminding borrowers of this important decision point encouraged them to consider the financial decision right for them.
