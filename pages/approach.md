## Approach 

OES is a team of applied experts based at the General Services Administration (GSA) that combines academic expertise with experience implementing and evaluating evidence-based program improvements. The private sector quickly learns what does not work,  what works, and what works most cost-effectively - government should, too.  OES supports GSA’s Office of Government-wide Policy’s mission to “use policies, evidence, and analysis to help agencies drive efficiency, savings, and improved mission performance.”


OES work directly with agency collaborators across government to:
- Use existing administrative data to measure outcomes that matter
- Design operationally feasible, no- or low-cost changes to improve agency outcomes using proven insights
- Integrate rigorous evaluations within current program implementation and agency constraints, to learn quickly what works and doesn’t, and what is cost-effective to improve agency outcomes
- Provide technical services and capacity building on how to implement and analyze rigorous evaluations
- Disseminate results and learnings to government and the public
