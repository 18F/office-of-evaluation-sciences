## How does OES work? 

A team based at the General Services Administration (GSA) is uniquely situated to deploy technical support, provide an independent yet intergovernmental perspective, and work to develop standards for high-quality evaluations in the government environment. The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) mission, function and operational model aim to engage a wide variety of agencies to answer priority questions and build evidence where it is lacking. 

As a federal partner working directly with agencies to design, launch and analyze rigorous rapid cycle evaluations, OES builds the capacity of federal teams and is uniquely available to develop iterative collaborations over multiple years to fill evidence gaps.  

OES team members aim to follow three guiding principles:
  - <b>Humbly collaborate</b>: Civil servants with years of experience are the experts on how their programs are run, and often have the best ideas for how to improve them. OES team members bring a new lense for implementing a program change and rapid cycle evaluation, but only in collaboration with those on-the-ground at the frontlines of public service. No sustainable change can occur if the people within partner agencies do not have a say in the process or do not participate in the design and implementation of an evaluation. Our single objective is to enable agencies to better achieve their mission for the nation.
  - <b>Bring the highest level of rigor and research integrity</b>: Our team can bring leading practices and experts into government to help tackle our nation’s toughest challenges, and working in this notoriously complex environment does not mean compromising the scientific method. This includes using randomized evaluations whenever possible, pre-registering analyses, writing and releasing code under the assumption that others will want to reproduce our work, provide general guidelines for the decisions we make during analysis and design, and make our process publicly available for feedback. We can be agile and creative, finding ways to rigorously evaluate what is working (and what is not) to enable government to better serve the public.  
  - <b>Act transparently and openly</b>: We keep a public record of all evaluations fielded, publicize our findings (whether they are null, supporting or opposing our own prior expectations), and when applicable, submit our work for publication via peer-review. If others in the Federal government, as well as State and Local entities, can see our processes, plans, and results, they can use these resources to conduct their own tests and policy interventions and can also  improve the work already done.

## OES Resources 

Through our work across the Federal government, we commit to producing tools for others to adapt, apply, and learn from our process.   Consider the below “working drafts” that will continually be updated as we improve our own work.
