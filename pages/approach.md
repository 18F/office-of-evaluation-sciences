## How does OES work? 

Our team tackles some of our nationâ€™s toughest challenges in a complex government environment and must provide results that policymakers and program designers can act on with the highest degree of confidence. 

OES team members follow three guiding principles:

- <b>Bring the highest level of rigor and <a href="https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa-oes/office-of-evaluation-sciences/Resources/resources/">research integrity:</a></b> OES employs research methods that are rigorous, reliable, and reproducible including using randomized evaluations whenever possible, pre-committing to publicly posted analysis plans, submitting our analyses to internal replication, and making our processes and methods publicly available for feedback.  
- <b>Act transparently and openly:</b> We are committed to ensuring that researchers, agency collaborators, policymakers, and the public at large are able to learn from our work. We keep a public record of all evaluations fielded and publicize all of our findings (including null findings and those that run counter to our own prior expectations and goals). 
- <b>Humbly collaborate:</b> Our collaborators, who are civil servants with years of experience working on delivering programs across the government, are the experts on how their programs work and often have the best ideas for how to improve them. Sustainable change is possible when the collaborators within partner agencies drive the process, participate in the design and implementation of an evaluation, assist in the analysis and interpretation of results, and make decisions about scale and program implications.
