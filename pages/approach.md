## What does OES do?

OES "scrubs in" to support agencies in using data and building evidence to deliver a better government. Team members provide end-to-end support in the design of an evidence-based program change and evaluation to measure impact.

## How does OES ensure the quality of its projects?

Our team tackles some of our nation’s toughest challenges in a complex government environment, developing strong evidence about what works and what doesn’t work — evidence that our agency collaborators can rely on when making decisions about how to design and run their programs moving forward. At OES we take this responsibility very seriously, and we have developed a [Research Integrity Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/ResearchIntegrity.pdf) to ensure that our projects are conducted to the highest social scientific standards.
