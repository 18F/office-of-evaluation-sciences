## How does OES work? 

A team based at the General Services Administration (GSA) is uniquely situated to deploy technical support to agencies across the Federal government, provide an independent yet intragovernmental perspective, and develop standards for high-quality evaluations in the government environment. The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) mission and operating model involve engaging a wide variety of agencies to answer high-priority questions and build evidence where it is lacking. 

As a federal partner working directly with agencies to design, launch and analyze rigorous rapid-cycle evaluations, OES enhances the capacity of federal teams and is uniquely available to develop iterative collaborations over multiple years to fill evidence gaps.  We are agile and creative as we find ways to rigorously evaluate what is working (and what is not) to enable government to better serve the public.

OES team members follow three guiding principles: 
  - <b>Humbly collaborate</b>: Civil servants with years of experience are the experts on how their programs work and often have the best ideas for how to improve them. OES team members can provide a new perspective on program design and evaluation , but only in collaboration with those on the ground and on the frontlines of public service. Sustainable change is possible when the people within partner agencies drive the process and participate in the design and implementation of an evaluation. Our single objective is to enable agencies to better achieve their missions for the nation.
  - <b>Bring the highest level of rigor and research integrity</b>: Our team aims to tackle our nationâ€™s toughest challenges in the notoriously complex government environment while at the same time employing research methods that are rigorous, reliable, and reproducible.  This includes using randomized evaluations whenever possible, pre-registering analyses, writing and releasing open-source code to teach others how to follow  our example, providing general guidelines for the decisions we make during analysis and design, and making our processes and methods publicly available for feedback.   
  - <b>Act transparently and openly</b>: We keep a public record of all evaluations fielded, publicize our findings (including null findings and those that run counter to our own prior expectations and goals), and, when possible, submit our work for publication via peer review in collaboration with academics at Universities. If others in the Federal government, as well as State and Local entities, can see our processes, plans, and results, they can use these resources to conduct their own tests of program changes, improving the work already done.

## OES Resources 

In addition to making our own research as rigorous, reliable, and reproducible as possible, we are committed to making our research tools available for others to apply or adapt to their own work. Below are some of these tools, which are continuously under development as we refine our methods and learn from our own projects. 

Find these useful? Have suggestions for improvement? We look forward to hearing from you!
