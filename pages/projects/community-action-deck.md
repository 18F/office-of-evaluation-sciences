## A tool for local conversations

In 2015, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing generated 59 recommendations with 92 action items across 6 pillars. These action items were directed to Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement, government, school systems, and local communities. 

This tool was developed to empower individuals to identify concrete actions that can be taken locally to address issues facing their communities, and connect them to available Federal resources and real-world examples of how these actions have successfully been implemented. A set of 30 cards outlines discussion topics drawn from the final report, focusing on strategies to advance the recommendations. Blank card templates can be used for communities to create their own action steps.
