## Our Approach

We strive to work alongside agency collaborators, enabling federal agencies to bridge the gap between ultimate program objectives and on-the-ground implementation. These projects reflect the work of the OES team and dedicated civil servants across the federal government.

We aim to publicly share the findings of each of our engagements. Below are selected project summaries, and individual project abstracts can be found on the tabs at the left.
