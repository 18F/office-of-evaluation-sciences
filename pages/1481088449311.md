## Call for 2017 Applicants

The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) is currently accepting applications for a fellowship beginning in October 2017 in Washington, D.C.. Based the General Services Administration, OES is a team of applied researchers tasked with incorporating behavioral insights into federal programs, and testing and learning what works. OES partners with federal agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of new evidence-based interventions on program outcomes and  provides agencies evidence to make informed programmatic decisions.

Over the past two years, OES has completed over 30 randomized evaluations with agency partners. OES has made major strides serving agencies and improving federal programs by applying and testing the impact of behavioral insights on a diverse range of agency outcomes.  Dozens of agencies have joined this effort, creating innovative partnerships to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the United States and abroad. OES has rigorously tested insights on diverse agencies priorities such as promoting retirement security, responding to climate change, supporting criminal justice reform, assisting job seekers, helping families get health coverage and stay healthy, and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government operations.

Most team members join OES on-loan from academic, nonprofit, or government offices on either a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis, typically for one to two years. Team members have joined from a variety of universities (e.g. City University of New York, Northeastern University, North Carolina State University, Reed College, University of Arizona, and University of Washington), non-profits (e.g. NBER, ideas42), and federal departments (e.g. Department of Education, Department of Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development Department). Other types of federal appointments may be offered on a limited basis.

The OES team combines academic expertise with experience implementing and evaluating evidence-based interventions in complex settings. Responsibilities of OES Fellows include:

* Driving project implementation on 3-5 projects at any given time, including collaborating and communicating regularly with agency partners to ensure that: intervention ideas and the pilot design meet agency goals; field experiments are implemented as planned; and the implications of results are clearly understood.

* Understanding agency objectives and priorities, identifying opportunities to translate findings from the social and behavioral sciences into concrete recommendations.

* Working directly with agency collaborators to design and rigorously test interventions.

* Performing data analyses and interpretation.

* Distilling findings into reports, policy memos and academic publications.

* Assisting, as needed, on additional projects being managed by other team members.
