## Partnership Overview

Since 2015, OES and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have collaborated to apply evidence-based insights and conduct rigorous, low-cost tests on child and maternal health and infectious diseases programs around the world. The goal of the partnership is to identify cost-effective, evidence-based changes that can be scaled for broader impact.
