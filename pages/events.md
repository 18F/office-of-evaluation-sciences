How can agencies use evidence to improve the way government serves the public? The GSA Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) will share examples and host a workshop on this important topic on December 14th, 2017.

In September of this year, the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking shared <a href="https://www.cep.gov/cep-final-report.html">recommendations</a> for how federal agencies can make better use of existing data to improve program operations and outcomes. In October, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2017/press.html">Richard Thaler was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics</a> for his work developing the field of behavioral economics and its relevance for policymaking. Join us to discuss the implications of these events for federal programs.

Please RSVP by <b>Monday, December 4, 2017</b>.

## Applying Rigorous Evaluation to Your Work

In this introductory session (for Federal employees), we will discuss methods and tools that OES has used for conducting rapid, yet rigorous evaluations of potential improvements to federal programs. It is intended for program managers/staff who might like to adapt and use these methods within their own offices, as well as for those who might like to collaborate with OES. We will focus on designing rapid, low-cost evaluations using existing administrative data that can that can improve a wide range of programs and outcomes. Future sessions will go into greater depth for more technical evaluation audiences.
