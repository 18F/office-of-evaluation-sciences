In 2017, <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2017/press.html">Richard Thaler was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics</a> for his work developing the field of Behavioral Economics. In September of this year, the Speaker Ryan and Senator Murray sponsored Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking <a href="https://www.cep.gov/cep-final-report.html">developed recommendations</a> for how the Federal government can make better use of existing data to improve how government programs operate. Forthcoming <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174">legislation</a> codifies some of these recommendations. 

How can agencies apply these lessons to their own work to improve programs and policy? The Office of Evaluation Sciences collaborates with agencies across government to apply research insights from the social and behavioral sciences to better design government for people and implement these program changes using rapid, rigorous, evaluation to more quickly learn what works, what works best, and what does not work. 

To close out 2017, OES will host two events at the General Services Administration, 1800 F St NW, Washington DC 20006 to highlight to share lessons learned from this work, and also provide training for Federal employees who are interested in incorporating it into their own day-to-day operations. Directions and agenda to follow. 

<b>Please RSVP by Monday December 4, 2017.</b>  We look forward to seeing you there!

## 2017 Results Discussion 

In the context of the broader movement for evidence-based policy, and with the recent release of the recommendations of the Commission on Evidence Based Policymaking and forthcoming legislation, representatives from across government and from Academia will discuss the relevance of OES' approach and findings. OES team members and Agency Partners will together highglight some of the results of their collaborations.

## Applying Rigorous Evaluation to your Work

This introductory session on designing evaluations and rigorous pilots is intended for program managers/staff who might like to adapt and use these methods within their own offices and for those who might like to collaborate with OES. (Future sessions will be offered for more technical evaluation audiences.)
- <b>When:</b> December 14th, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM
- <b>Who Should Attend:</b> Federal employees curious about how they can conduct rapid evaluations in the course of implementing their programs in order to build evidence about whether potential program improvements actually work.
