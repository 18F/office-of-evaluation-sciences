## SBST Spring 2016 Recruitment

Based at the General Services Administration, the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) maintains the institutional home for the team of experts dedicated to driving and delivering the work of the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team (SBST). Since our inception in 2014, we have completed over 15 randomized evaluations with a diverse set of agency collaborators. Please see the [About](https://sbst.gov/about), [Work](https://sbst.gov/work), and [Resources](https://sbst.gov/resources) tabs to learn more about our recent activities.

We are currently seeking new team members to join us in Washington, D.C. for a one-year fellowship beginning in October 2016. Fellows and Associate Fellows translate insights from the social and behavioral sciences into concrete recommendations on how to improve Federal programs, policies, and operations. We work closely with agency collaborators to identify opportunities for improvement and evaluate the relative efficiency and effectiveness of proposed interventions.

These include knowledge of at least one field within the social and behavioral sciences, the ability to creatively apply research knowledge within the Federal government setting, the ability to design and manage the day-to-day operations of a field trial, and exceptional communication and interpersonal skills.

* Fellows have substantial expertise in a social or behavioral science field. Typically they are researchers with a PhD in a social or behavioral science field (e.g., economics, psychology, political science, statistics, sociology, public policy, etc.) and on leave or coming to SBST from positions at universities, government agencies, or other research organizations.

Additionally, applicants must possess:

* General knowledge of applied social and behavioral sciences and specialized knowledge of at least one domain of study within the social and behavioral sciences.

* Ability to think creatively about how insights from the social and behavioral sciences can be translated into concrete interventions that are feasible within specific Federal programs, policies or organizations.

* Statistical competency in at least one programming language (e.g., R, Stata, Matlab, SAS).

* Knowledge of rigorous evaluation methods, such as randomized controlled trials.

* Ability to effectively explain technical concepts to a broad range of audiences, orally and in writing.

* Strong and concise writing skills, including under tight deadlines.

* Excellent project management and organizational skills.

* Flexibility, self-motivation, and the ability to manage multiple tasks efficiently as a team player.

* Curiosity and willingness to learn about Federal agencies and their unique practical and regulatory constraints.

Preferred qualifications include:

* Experience conducting randomized evaluations in field settings.

* Experience working with Federal, state, or local governments.

* Advanced statistical skills, including experience handling large administrative data sets.

Applicants do not need to be U.S. citizens.

### Fellowship Details

The primary responsibilities of both Fellows and Associate Fellows include:

* Understanding agency objectives and priorities in order to translate applicable findings into concrete recommendations.

* Working directly with agency collaborators to design and rigorously test interventions.

* Implementing projects, including communicating regularly with agency partners and any outside collaborators to ensure: the intervention and study design meet agency goals; evaluations are implemented as planned; timely and accurate data analyses and interpretation; and findings are distilled into project reports and policy memos for academic, agency, and public audiences.

* Assisting, as needed, on additional projects being managed by other team members.

* Attending weekly team meetings, providing updates on project status, and being generally available to collaborate on and contribute to internal team tasks.
