## Research Integrity 

Results from OES studies impact the lives of millions of Americans, and thus the quality of our work and reliability of our findings are of paramount importance. At OES we take this responsibility very seriously, and we have developed strict practices to ensure our results and findings are reliable. 

A key component of this process is committing to a detailed analysis plan before we begin working with data. Why is this important? As the recent replication crisis in the social sciences has shown, if researchers allow themselves too much flexibility and inadvertently go “fishing” for patterns in data, then statistical analyses can yield unreliable results — and, in particular, “false positives.” In our case, this would mean getting a result indicating that a program or policy change was effective when it fact it was due to random “noise” in the data. 

To ensure we don’t fall into this trap, we commit to a detailed analysis plan before we analyze data — a best practice that has received greater attention in the social sciences in recent years. In particular, we commit ourselves to specific outcome variables and analytic methods, and we date-stamp the plan and post it on our website so that others can hold us accountable, other researchers can verify that our methods are sound, and policymakers can base decisions on our results with confidence. Publicly posting our analysis plans is just one component of our larger Research Integrity Framework, provided below, which helps ensure we are providing timely, reliable, and actionable evidence to agency collaborators.

## Project Delivery

Below are templates of some of the documents we use to support our Research Integrity Framework and help us streamline, document, and manage our work. Please consider these living documents, as we are continuously refining our methods and learning from our own projects. We hope to continue to add to this list soon! 

- OES Project Initiation Document
- OES Project Design Document
- OES Analysis Plan Document
- OES Record of Analysis and Findings Document
