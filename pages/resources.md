## Tools for Project Delivery

Below are templates of some of the documents we use to support our Research Integrity Framework and help us streamline, document, and manage our work. Please consider these living documents, as we are continuously refining our methods and learning from our own projects. We hope to continue to add to this list soon! 

- [OES Guide to Research Integrity]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/ResearchIntegrity.pdf)
- [OES Project Design Document]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/ProjectDesign.pdf)
- [OES Analysis Plan Document]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/AnalysisPlan.pdf)
- [OES Record of Analysis and Findings Document]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/RecordAnalysis.pdf)
