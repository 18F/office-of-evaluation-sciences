## Background

Vaccines are one of the most important public health interventions, responsible for saving thousands of lives in the United States every year. Despite this, vaccine uptake for some vaccinations recommended in the Center for Disease Control (CDC) immunization schedules falls well below Healthy People 2020 targets, and the estimated economic burden of vaccine-preventable diseases among adults in the United States was about $9 billion in 2015 alone. 

The National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) has identified the low rates of adult vaccination as a priority, and to date, OES projects have focused on increasing flu vaccination rates and the completion of recommended immunization series among children, adults and seniors. OES works directly with delivery partners to identify existing programs where changes can be implemented and evaluated using rapid-cycle tests (embedded into existing operations) using random assignment. 

## Portfolio

Working with agency collaborators and delivery partners, OES has completed more than five randomized evaluations to test the impact of low-cost evidence-based program changes in improving vaccine uptake. We look forward to releasing results from these projects in late 2018.
