## Partnering with OES

Is your agency interested in doing a project with OES?

Below is a list of questions that can help you start to think about whether the challenge you're working on may be a good fit for the types of projects our skills are best suited for:

 - Does the program have an outcome of interest that depends in part on people’s actions (e.g., individuals taking up a program, adhering to appointments, providing accurate information)?
 - Does the program contain a clear touchpoint between the individual and the Federal government (e.g., a communication channel, a signup point)?
 - Is the outcome of the program already reflected in administrative data that is collected (or could be easily collected) by the agency? At what level is this data collected (e.g., individual, facility, state)?
 - How many units (e.g., individuals, facilities, states) are being served through this program? 
 - Would it be possible to assign units to different versions of an improvement in order to compare outcomes and learn what works best (e.g., half of program recipients receive information presented in a standard way, and half in a modified, research-insight based format)?

Think you have a good fit? Here’s how to get started:
<ol>
<li>Send us your initial responses to the questions above in an email to <a href="mailto:oes@gsa.gov?subject=Collaboration">oes@gsa.gov</a> to start the conversation</li>
<li>Someone from our office will reach out to you to learn more</li>
<li>Work with an OES team member to identify an area of collaboration</li>
</ol> 

We're excited to work with a variety of agencies, but naturally, we do not have the ability to respond to all project proposals. We consider each opportunity using the criteria described above, and also consider our teams' current makeup of skillsets and resources to assess our ability to collaborate.

## Joining OES

Full time OES team members are selected annually for our Fellowship program. These individuals come to the team for one year, are based in Washinton, D.C. and are often on loan from a variety of home institutions such as a university or another Federal agency. 

We are not currently recruiting Associate Fellows or Fellows at this time. Join our mailing list (at the bottom of the homepage) to be notified of our next recruitment cycle.

To learn more about these roles, [view the 2018 Fellowship Solicitation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/FY18Solicitation.pdf).

## Supporting OES as an Academic Affiliate 

We identify opportunities to work with agencies on an ongoing basis, and often need additional subject matter expertise. As an Academic Affiliate, you will be able to apply your work to improve government, and have the opportunity to publish results. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnuRSZNKZt9bVLAGw6G64i5oUNDqsGcrX7dvgGpvlac9Cog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Tell us about your area of expertise</a>, and we may reach out to you to collaborate on a specific project.
