## Partnering with OES

We’re excited to partner with new agency collaborators across government. What makes an opportunity a good fit for testing an evidence-based insight with OES?

- A clear touchpoint between the Federal government and an individual
- An outcome of interest that depends in part on people’s actions 
- An outcome of interest that is reflected in existing administrative data (or could be easily collected) 
- A program population size that is large enough to be statistically and policy relevant
- The ability to randomly assign groups of people to different versions of a program change 
- An agency collaborator willing to work alongside OES and to share results across government

Send a description of how your opportunity incorporates the elements above in an email to oes@gsa.gov to start the conversation. Naturally, we do not have the ability to respond to all project proposals, but we consider each opportunity using the criteria described above, our teams' current makeup of skillsets, and available resources to assess our ability to collaborate.

## Joining OES

Full time OES team members are selected annually, with applications often opening in late Fall. These individuals come to the team for one year, are based in Washington, D.C., and are often on loan from a variety of home institutions such as a university or another Federal agency. Join our mailing list (at the bottom of our homepage) to be notified of our next recruitment cycle. 

You can learn more about the position and what we look for by [viewing the 2018 Fellowship Solicitation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/FY18Solicitation.pdf).

## Supporting OES as an Academic Affiliate 

We often require specific subject matter expertise as we identify opportunities to work with agencies on an ongoing basis. As an Academic Affiliate, you will be able to apply your work to improve government, and have the opportunity to publish results. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnuRSZNKZt9bVLAGw6G64i5oUNDqsGcrX7dvgGpvlac9Cog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Tell us about your area of expertise</a>, and we may reach out to you to collaborate on a specific project.
