## Annual Fellowship

Full time OES team members are selected annually for our Fellowship program. These individuals come to the team for one year, are based in Washinton, D.C. and are often on loan from a variety of home institutions such as a university or another Federal agency. 

We are not currently recruiting Associate Fellows or Fellows at this time. Join our mailing list (at the bottom of the homepage) to be notified of our next recruitment cycle.

To learn more about these roles, [view the 2018 Fellowship Solicitation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/FY18Solicitation.pdf).


## Academic Affiliate 

We identify opportunities to work with agencies on an ongoing basis, and often need additional subject matter expertise. As an Academic Affiliate, you will be able to apply your work to improve government, and have the opportunity to publish results. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnuRSZNKZt9bVLAGw6G64i5oUNDqsGcrX7dvgGpvlac9Cog/viewform?usp=sf_link">Tell us about your area of expertise</a>, and we may reach out to you to collaborate on a specific project.
