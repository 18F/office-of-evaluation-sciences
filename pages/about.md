## What is the Office of Evaluation Sciences?

The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) is an interdisciplinary team embedded within the US Federal government that aims to deliver a better, more efficient government for people. 

We deploy experts both in how people access, process, and act on information and rapid, yet scientifically rigorous evaluation to work directly with agency collaborators to design evidence-based program changes and quickly test whether or not they work. 

## What guides us?

OES pairs teams of experts directly with agency collaborators to learn quickly what works and doesnâ€™t, and what is cost-effective to improve agency outcomes. A typical project involves:

  - Identifying existing administrative data sets that can be used to measure outcomes that matter
  - Designing operationally feasible, no- or low-cost changes using proven insights 
  - Integrating rigorous evaluations within current program implementation and agency constraints
  - Providing technical services and capacity building on how to implement and analyze rigorous evaluations
  - Disseminating results and learnings to government audiences and the public
