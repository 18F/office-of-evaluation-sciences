## What is the Office of Evaluation Sciences?

The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) is an interdisciplinary team of experts within the Federal government, housed at the U.S. General Services Administration,  that translates evidence-based insights into concrete recommendations for how to improve government and tests to learn what works.

## What does the Office of Evaluation Sciences do?

Team members work across government to provide end-to-end support in the design of an evidence-based program change and test to measure impact. Sustainable change is possible when OES works with collaborators who drive the process, participate in the design and implementation of an evaluation, assist in the analysis and interpretation of results, and make decisions about scale and program implications.

## Why is OES at GSA?

GSAâ€™s mission is to deliver value and savings in real estate, acquisition, technology, and other mission-support services across Government.. One of the ways it carries out this mission is through promoting management best practices and efficient government operations through the development of governmentwide policies.

OES supports this activity by working with agencies to use evidence and analysis to drive efficiency, savings, and improved mission performance. At GSA, OES is uniquely situated in a central entity that can easily deploy technical support, provide an independent yet intragovernmental perspective, and develop standards for high-quality evidence building activities in the Federal environment.
