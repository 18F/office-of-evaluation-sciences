## What is the Office of Evaluation Sciences?

The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) is an interdisciplinary team embedded within the US Federal government that aims to deliver a better, more efficient government for people. 

We deploy experts both in how people access, process, and act on information and rapid, yet scientifically rigorous evaluation to work directly with agency collaborators to design evidence-based program changes and quickly test whether or not they work. 

## What guides us?

Results from OES studies impact the lives of millions of Americans, and thus the quality of our work and reliability of our findings are of paramount importance. OES team members follow four guiding principles:

- <b>Bring the highest level of rigor and [research integrity]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/files/ResearchIntegrity.pdf):</b> OES employs research methods that are rigorous, reliable, and reproducible including using randomized evaluations whenever possible, pre-committing to publicly posted analysis plans, submitting our analyses to internal replication, and making our processes and methods publicly available for feedback.  
- <b>Act transparently and openly:</b> We are committed to ensuring that researchers, agency collaborators, policymakers, and the public at large are able to learn from our work. We keep a public record of all evaluations fielded and publicize all of our findings (including null findings and those that run counter to our own prior expectations and goals). 
- <b>Humbly collaborate:</b> Our collaborators, who are civil servants with years of experience working on delivering programs across the government, are the experts on how their programs work and often have the best ideas for how to improve them. Sustainable change is possible when the collaborators within partner agencies drive the process, participate in the design and implementation of an evaluation, assist in the analysis and interpretation of results, and make decisions about scale and program implications. 
- <b>Serve the public:</b> Our team members possess a passion for public service and improving our government. As a result of our projects, more Servicemembers are saving for retirement, more students are going to college, more Veterans are accessing their benefits, more farmers are obtaining credit, and agencies are operating more efficiently. Meaningful outcomes always drive our work.

## Why is OES at the General Services Administration?

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) exists to support the government in becoming more effective and efficient. One of the ways it does this is to promote management best practices and efficient government operations through the development of governmentwide policies. 

OES supports this activity by working with agencies to use evidence and analysis to drive efficiency, savings, and improved mission performance. At GSA, OES is uniquely situated in a central entity that can easily deploy technical support, provide an independent yet intragovernmental perspective, and develop standards for high-quality evidence building activities in the Federal environment.
