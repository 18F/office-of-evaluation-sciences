Dennis Kramer is an Assistant Professor of Education Policy and Director of the Education Policy Research Center at the University of Florida. Kramer’s research focuses on the use of behavioral insights to understand education-based decision-making, the antecedents and outcomes of federal, state, and local policies, and economics of education. Kramer is a Co-PI on a funded study that examines the impact of informational “nudges” and fiscal incentives as mechanisms to increase student re-enrollment in community colleges. Additionally, he is leading a field-based experiment that examines the role of structural default choice settings on student loan take-up and disbursement.
