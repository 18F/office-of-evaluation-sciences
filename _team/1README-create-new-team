Steps to create a new team member page and post to the website:

TO CREATE A PAGE
1) save your headshot to your desktop, title it as "first name-last name" being sure to separate the names with a dash, upload your headshot into /assets/img/team/
  - leave this window open in a separate tab for easy copy/pasting later
3) have two windows/tabs open - this instructional readme, and then the _team folder on github
4) click "create new file" in the uper right corner
5) in the text box following /assets/_team/, enter in:
  - your first and last name, separated by a dash
  - ".md" to ensure the page formats correctly
  - EXAMPLE: mo-earley.md
6) copy and paste the text below this numbered list (beginning with ---, being sure to include the three dashes (---) in line 1) into the new page you created in the separate tab. NOTE: the text following the colons (:) below has been maintained as an example, and additional notes have been provided following the arrows <<--.
7) Per instructions next to the arrows (<<--), update information for your project and paste in content from project slide where instructed
8) remove all notes pasted in to the form (including <<-- and comments)
9) scroll down to the radio buttons and select "Create a new branch"
10) name the branch with your name
11) commit changes
12) email Amira and Mo to let us know you have built the page for our review
